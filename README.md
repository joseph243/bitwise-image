Bitwise Image Editor

A project to learn bitwise operations in java.

Select an image from disk, and perform various operations to transform the RGB values for each pixel.

Transformations are each their own experimental bitwise operation.

Some session management stuff to enable debug / prevent accidental data loss / apply multiple transformations in order.
